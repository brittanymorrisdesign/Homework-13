# Objective
A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, and Handlebars. Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate HTML. Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
